##### Unoptimized Dot Product
Although our dot product implementation is pretty fast with small to medium sized matrices, it becomes prohibitively slow with big matrices.
Efficient matrix multiplication is a field of its own.
Numpy uses heavily optimized well-known BLAS [general matrix multiplication `gemm`](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-developer-reference-fortran-gemm) routine.
